   file name: bcel-6.5.0.jar

   Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics.
   However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode.
   This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more
   control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.

   CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write

   Used by SpotBugs.
